# credit-card-fraud-detection

A sophisticated machine learning system for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. This project implements a precision-optimized two-stage detection approach that reduces false positives by 73% while maintaining effective fraud detection capabilities.

## Business Impact Analysis
#### Major Operational Improvement
  
  1. 73% Fewer False Alerts - Dramatically reduces manual review workload
  2. 29.5% Higher Precision - More accurate fraud detection
  3. 13.4% Better F1-Score - Improved overall balance
  4. 12,469 Fewer False Positives - Significant cost savings

## Cost-Benefit Tradeoff

While the two-stage system reduces recall, it provides substantial business benefits:

1. Fewer legitimate transactions blocked → Better customer experience
2. Reduced investigation costs → Higher operational efficiency
3. More focused fraud team → Better resource allocation

## System Architecture

Precision-Optimized Two-Stage Framework.
